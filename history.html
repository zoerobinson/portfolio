      <h2>History of Namibia</h2><br>

      <h3>A Brief Introduction</h3><br>
      <p>Namibia is still in its infancy, having achieved indepdence in 1990. The country has a dark and devastating history, which it is just beginning to learn how to overcome. In 1884, what is now known as Namibia became a German settlement, although the Germans expressed little interest in settling there due to harsh conditions. As time went on, Germany began to see Namibia as an opportunity for investment and exploitation, especially due to it's prime location on the coast. From there began terrible conflict and what is known as the "The Genodcide of the Second Reich" (Second Reich refers to the uprising of the German Empire). In present-day Namibia, the German influence is still prevelant in their architecture, language, and culture. Namibians are proud people from diverse backgrounds working towards the rebuilding of their nation.

      <h3>War & Genocide</h3><br>
      <p>Between 1904 and 1907, Germany committed his first genocide in Namibia and has explicitly planned the extermination of two people: the Namas and the Hereros. Two-thirds of the Herero people and the half of the Nama people of the German colony were killed, many in concentration camps. In 1884, Namibia became a German colony. While at first, the Germans showed little interest in Namibia, the number of German settlers gradually increased until in 1904 the Herero people rose in rebellion. However, the Germans brutally suppressed the uprising. The Nama people in Namibia began a guerrilla war but by 1907 they had been defeated, again with great brutality.

      In 1915, during the First World War the South Africans captured Namibia. After the war former German colonies were given to the allied powers and called mandates. Namibia was made a British mandate and was to be administered by South Africa.

      <h3>Freedom</h3><br>
      <p>In 1966 SWAPO (South West Africa People's Organization) began a long guerrilla war in Namibia. Finally, in 1988 South Africa agreed to allow Namibia to become independent. A constitution was written and Namibia became independent on 21 March 1990. Since independence, Namibia has successfully completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to a democratic society and is considered to have a stable government.
