        <h1>Traveling in Namibia</h1><br>

          <h2>Etosha National Park</h2><br>
            <p>Etosha National Park is a nature conservation area in northern Namibia and is one of the most significant game reserves in Africa. In Namibia, it is by far the best known and most important national park. Today, the Park covers an area of nearly 22.912 km² and is completely fenced for the protection of the animals.

            The name Etosha is derived from the Oshiwambo and means “big, white place”. More than 100 mammal species and 340 different species of birds are found in the park. It is home to four out of the Big Five animals (lion, leopard, rhino, elephant, buffalo). Due to over-hunting in the 1800’s, unfortunately, you won’t be able to find any Cape buffalo in Etosha today. 
            </p><br>

          <h2>Sossusvlei</h2><br>
            <p>Sossusvlei is located in the Namib Naukluft desert, and is surrounded by sand dunes in every direction. These are the world’s tallest dunes and climbing them is a bucket-list item for many travelers in Namibia. Some are famous, such as the 170-metre-high Dune 45, which is one of the most climbed dunes due to its accessibility next to the road 45 kilometres from Sesriem, and Big Daddy – a towering 350 metres above Deadvlei. Others, like Hiddenvlei, require more effort and trekking off the beaten path for the reward. But the untouched red dunes are well worth it - and every photographers' dream.
            </p><br>

          <h2>Luderitz</h2><br>
            <p>Luderitz is a quirky town in Southern Namibia lodged in one of the best harbors on the least hospitable coast in Africa. Colourful buildings built during the time of German occupation line the streets, and businesses more than a hundred years old can be found on some of the streets. One of Luderitz' main attractions is Kolmanskop Ghost Town. This previously bustling diamond town is now abandoned and fights a constant struggle with the sand dunes of the Namib desert. It is not exactly convenient for tourists to travel to Luderitz since it is so far South from other tourist attractions, but it is well worth the trip if you're an adventurous soul looking for rugged landscapes and eerie history.
