      <h1>Namibian Culture</h1><br>
      <h2>Ethnic Group and Tribes</h2><br>
      <p>Namibia is comprised of many ethnic groups and tribes, some who are native and some the result of war and relocation. About 50% of the population is represented by the members of the Ovambo tribe, who are primarily located in Northern Namibia. The Kavango (Northest), Herero (South), Damara (South), Nama (South), Caprivian (Zambezi strip), San (East), Baster (East), and Tswana (East) peoples comprise 9%, 7%, 7%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, and 0.5% of the population, respectively. The culture of Namibia is an amalgamation of the cultures of these ethnic groups.

      <h2>Language</h2><br>
      <p>Each tribe in Namibia has it's own mothertongue, of which most consist of multiple dialects. Primarily, Bantu languages are spoken in the nothern portion of the country. In central and southern Namibia, Afrikaans (a Dutch-influenced language) is spoken, along with languages from the Khoisan family which are referred to as "click languages".
      </p><br>

      <h2>Cuisine</h2><br>
      <p>The cuisine of Namibia is influenced by practices of indigenous inhabitants and that introduced by German colonization. First and foremost, meat is extremely important in many Namibian cultures, and food is not considered a "meal" without meat. Millet, sorghum, melons, peanuts, beef, mutton, and dairy products are the primary food products in Namibia. Mealie pap, which is a stiff porridge made from ground maize meal or mahangu (a maize-like corn grown in the North), is the staple diet of the people. Prior to colonization, the cuisine of Namibia used a wide range of plant products gathered from wild plants and meat obtained by the hunting of wild animals. Livestock breeding began in Namibia about 2000 years back. That made meat and milk easily available. When German colonists settled in Namibia in the 19th century, German dishes were introduced in the country. Dishes like Wiener schnitzel and the German brewing tradition are quite popular in Namibia today.
